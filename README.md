## Portfolio

This is my first instalment of a portfolio. Even though it is far from a finished product. It was a great way to get my feet wet in HTML and CSS. I used two css style sheets and linked them to my html files. 

## Major Take-Aways

I tried hard to only use float and positions when styling this first website. I wanted to get an idea of how to operate these functions without the use of flexbox or css grid. In a future instalment, I could see how modeling the portfolio.html page with flexbox or css grid would be beneficial. 


## Shout-Outs

I used w3schools to get a rough understanding how to model my header and am quite pleased with the turn out. It is simple in its makeup, however i find it visually pleasing. 

## Short-Comings

The portfolio page is rough.... I learned how to not seat a div and float relative to it. This caused my portfolio page to be enormous. Instead of removing the unneeded boxes, I left them as a good reminder on how not to work positions. Not to mention the 3+ hours I spent getting them into position. One other shortcoming is my choice of pallet. I find it not the best layout and kind of "wix.com-ish" I look forward to expanding my ideas in styling different projects in the future.
